# Contributing to this project

The easiest way to contribute is by [opening issues](https://github.com/hackedbrain/ikspoz/issues)
for bugs or feature requests. For bugs, please apply the `bug` label. For
feature requests please apply the `enhancement` label.

If you're feeling adventurous you may also open a PR to address the issue, but
please always make sure to always start by opening an issue with details and
then link the issue to it. PRs without issues _will not_ be accepted.

## Getting Started

This is a primarily .NET based project so you will need some experience working
with [the .NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) and the C# language.

> Please note: This project is in its infancy and this documentation will be
> expanded upon as the project evolves.
